The following instructions will prepare you for the work we’ll be doing on Feb 12th. It’s important to do this quick prep prior to our meeting so that we can maximize the time we have together to configure your local server environment and play around with your WordPress “sandbox” while you have the opportunity to ask live-time questions and get immediate feedback.

MAMP
----

### Requirements

MacOS Sierra 10.12 or later

Windows 10.0 or later

### Description

MAMP stands for macOS (your computer’s operating system—don’t worry, this will work on Windows, too), Apache (the web server you’ll be using), MySQL (your database management system, which is key to maintaining your own WordPress instance), and PHP, in our case (this is the web development programming language our sandbox will use).

This server environment, also known as a “stack”, is one of the more straightforward means of setting up a local server on your computer. If this all sounds unfamiliar and even confusing to you, don’t worry, you don’t have to understand it all right now. For now, let’s simply download it!

### Download & install

Go to the MAMP downloads page: [<u>https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/</u>](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)

1.  Select the download button in the **‘Download MAMP & MAMP PRO’** section that corresponds to your operating system, either Mac or Windows.

> **Windows Instructions**

1.  Double click on the setup\_MAMP\_MAMP\_PRO\_4.x.exe in your Downloads folder

2.  Follow the Windows Installer installation instructions to finish

> **Mac Instructions**

1.  Double click on the MAMP\_MAMP\_PRO\_6.x.pkg in your Downloads folder

2.  Follow the System Installation instructions

*Do not move or rename your MAMP folder.*

**Note:** After installing, you’ll notice 2 instances of MAMP on your computer: MAMP & MAMP PRO. *Ignore MAMP PRO*. Don’t try to delete it or move it, simply ignore it. That’s the paid version, which we won’t be using. As long as you have C:\\MAMP (Windows) or MAMP (Mac) on your computer, you’re all set!

### Requirements

If you’ve successfully installed MAMP, you’ve met the requirements to download WordPress!

### Description

WordPress is a free and open-source content manager that is most commonly used as a website publishing platform for a wide variety of sites such as business websites, personal blogs, and, you guessed it, journals!

Some of you may already be familiar with WordPress, and have maybe even worked with it in some of your classes at Geneseo. Typically, when you use WordPress, you’re using it on the web at a domain that anyone can look up and visit. That’s not how we’ll be doing things for this assignment.

Rather, we’ll be setting up WordPress on your personal computer as what we refer to as a “sandbox” so that we can “play” around without worrying about how it looks to others. Let’s get started!

### Download

1.  Go to the download section of the “Get WordPress” page: [<u>https://wordpress.org/download/\#download-install</u>](https://wordpress.org/download/#download-install)

2.  Select the “Download WordPress 5.6” button

3.  Move the .zip file from your Downloads folder to somewhere you’ll be able to find it easily when we meet on Feb 12

That’s it!
